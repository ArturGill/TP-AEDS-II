This paper analyzes female participation in terms of the thematic relevance of comments posted in GitHub's issue tracking environment. The paper also investigates whether there are relationships between thematic relevance and other metrics linked to the developer, such as reputation, platform time and number of issues reported. Data from 5 open source communities and 5 dedicated to women were analyzed. The results indicate that, on average, the relevance of comments made by women is similar to that of men, showing themselves to be equally capable, but they demonstrate very low representation and participation, having only 22% of the comments posted and 16% of the issues reported.
