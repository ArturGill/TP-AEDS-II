In modern times, faced with the relentless evolution of technology, humans tend to establish a closer relationship with machines. Promising studies focused on Machine Learning demonstrate that the human-machine relationship has evolved significantly. This work will address Deep Learning, which is one of the specific branches of Machine Learning, for classifying audio samples of musical instruments. The objective is to determine the accuracy of the performance between Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks, making a comparison and identifying significant factors that may interfere in the final result. After training the Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks, accuracy rates of 88% and 96.5% were obtained, respectively. It can be seen that for classifying audio samples, the convolution techniques used in Convolutional Neural Networks are more efficient.
