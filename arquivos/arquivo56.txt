The market currently includes a wide range of mobile applications. Since they are in direct contact with users who often do not have technical knowledge, the usability of such applications is an important and decisive factor for their widespread use. However, the literature does not yet provide sufficient support for systems of this class to be properly tested and evaluated. This work proposes the evaluation of ease of use in mobile applications of a specific class, through the use of a structured methodology for joint usability evaluation, formed by the combined use of usability testing and heuristic evaluation. Four event support applications were selected for the experiments (myMobiConf, Whova, mConference and Event Cadence). The results show that the joint usability evaluation presents satisfactory results, in addition to offering a broader view of the technical and usability failures of mobile applications.
