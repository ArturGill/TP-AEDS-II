Context-aware transit is a line of research that has gained relevance in recent years due to the increase in IoT-related devices and applications. Much of the work in this area proposes approaches for private vehicles, leaving aside research related to public transportation. In this work, a generic strategy for constructing safer bus routes was implemented and evaluated. The solution constructed, in addition to generating routes maintaining the original stopping points, also proposes improvements by relocating some of these to safer regions. The results for the relocated stopping points showed that it was possible to reduce road traffic in unsafe areas by up to 20%, with a route length increase of just 13%.
