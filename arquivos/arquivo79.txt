Modern processors have adopted new measures to improve their performance. The first, out-of-order execution, allows instructions further down the flow to be executed in parallel with previous ones. Another solution was speculative execution, which executes instructions assuming that they are really needed later. However, it was recently discovered that both allow access to places in memory that should not be accessible. Thus, large companies in the industry, such as Intel, AMD, ARM, among others, developed patches to correct these vulnerabilities. Even though they mitigate the impacts generated by attempts to access private places in memory, the patches directly impact the performance of current systems. This article presents a study on these vulnerabilities, known as Meltdown and Spectre. We verified the effect and effectiveness of speculative execution and, when successful, we were able to calculate the impact on computational performance with and without a security patch. From tests done on benchmarks, we obtain a performance loss of a little over 10% on protected systems. Index Termsâ€”Out-of-order execution, Speculative execution, Cache memory, Meltdown, Spectre.
