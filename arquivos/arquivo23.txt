Until a few decades ago, motor vehicles were not accessible to the majority of the Brazilian population, but today they are a reality in many people's homes. They are products that are targeted for theft, as well as being used to commit theft. With this growing number of vehicles in circulation and their use for theft, there has also been an interest in monitoring these vehicles, whether for traffic control, vehicle management in parking lots, capture of offenders and other activities. With this in mind, this work proposes the development of an algorithm that is capable of recognizing vehicle license plates in images (photos) and videos, and extracting their characters, allowing an analysis of the data. The objective is that, based on the results of this work, it will be possible to develop a real application capable of controlling the flow of vehicles, such as a garage, parking lot or surveillance system. For this, the YOLO model was used for the convolutional neural network, trained with a dataset and applied to videos made in real traffic. The results indicate
a model capable of locating license plates with 90% accuracy and extracting
character from the plate with 50% success.
