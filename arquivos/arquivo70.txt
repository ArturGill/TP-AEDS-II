This study performs a joint analysis of data from issue tracking and version control environments. The objective is to identify possible sources of rework in software projects, in two categories of issues: those with associated code and those that, although they involved many discussions, did not converge into code. The data were extracted from projects stored on the GitHub platform. To this end, statistical analyses were applied, such as: correlation, multiple regression and hypothesis testing. The analyses were performed on data related to the following parameters: number of commits, number of comments, number of developers and number of reopenings. These parameters were analyzed together, to verify the influences between them. The results obtained showed that the selected parameters may have a strong relationship with sources of rework in the two categories of issues evaluated.
