Monitoring the weight of beef cattle is extremely important for rural producers. This proposal seeks to predict the weight of animals automatically, with an emphasis on extracting information from images, using computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In contrast to the conventional method with mechanical scales, the new approach proposes the generation of a dataset containing images of cattle, used to train a U-NET model capable of segmenting the animal. Relevant attributes are then extracted and machine learning models are trained to predict cattle weight. The approach was implemented in Python and executed on the Google Colab and Google Cloud Virtual Machines platforms. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12.83 kg.
