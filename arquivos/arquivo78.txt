Considering the widespread use of computer systems in various contexts and the amount of sensitive information they produce, it is essential to pay attention to their security. The objective of this work is to explore the use of clustering techniques and statistical analysis for anomaly detection in an information security database. A comparative analysis will be made between different techniques in NSL-KDD, in terms of accuracy, chosen attributes, execution scenario, among others. Five unsupervised techniques were chosen for comparison: Random Forests, Local Outlier Factor, Elliptic Envelope, K Means and HBOS. The results obtained vary considerably depending on the scenario in which they were applied. After analyzing the results obtained, it became clear that the performance of the chosen techniques is sensitive to the context and its application configuration.
