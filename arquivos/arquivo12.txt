Although association is a powerful tool for business, it does not always indicate causality. Therefore, in recent years, much has been studied and researched in this area. As a result, new problems have emerged. Among them is the automated generation of causal models, a crucial part of the study of causality. Although there are tools that attempt to meet this demand, for cases involving many variables they do not do so well. Therefore, this work proposes an efficient solution based on an evolutionary algorithm for suggesting causal models, dedicated mainly to cases involving a large number of parameters. The solution was evaluated on a data set with 14 thousand entries and 63 dimensions. The results showed that it was possible to create a relevant causal model using the evolutionary algorithm approach, while two tools in the literature did not achieve satisfactory results. As future work, we intend to improve the tool proposed in this work in order to increase its accuracy and effectiveness in discovering causal effects.
