With the increasing use of mobile devices, more applications are being developed and published to meet consumer needs. With so many options, users may find it difficult to select a mobile application to meet their needs. A common solution to this problem is to develop recommendation systems that aim to recommend applications based on user needs that users would be likely to install on their own. In this work, we use chronological information from the installation sequences of 14,000 users to improve algorithms traditionally used for recommendation systems. Our results show an average increase of up to 16% in recall for collaborative filters and 36% for Markov Chain, compared to the same models not using chronological information.
