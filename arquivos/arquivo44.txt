Participatory Sensing Networks (PSN) suffer from a lack of active user participation, sometimes resulting in low data collection, which can directly affect the quality of their analyses. To reduce this problem, this study applies a gamification approach as an intrinsic incentive mechanism to improve and make more enjoyable the use of a PSN application to support events, created by the “Center for Studies in Pervasive and Distributed Systems” (NesPED), of the Federal University of Viçosa, Florestal Campus. By using game elements such as points, rankings and awards, as well as the creation of user groups to improve interaction among participants, and the development of a quantitative approach to inhibit the sending of spam in opinions, an important result was obtained in the case study, carried out with participants of the Academic Week of the Computer Science course. The impact was significant in the groups that used the module with gamification, improving user interaction and engagement, thus generating more effective participation in the event and, consequently, an increase in the amount of feedback data for the organizers, increasing the average number of opinions sent by almost 12 times, without impacting their quality.
