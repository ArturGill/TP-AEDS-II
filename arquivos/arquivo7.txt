Currently, several technologies that use GPS (Global Positioning System) as a location solution are available for different application fields. However, the accuracy of these technologies can vary greatly, especially inside buildings where there may be numerous satellite signal blocks. Alternative approaches for these scenarios that have good results usually use additional infrastructure to improve accuracy. The approach of this work, in turn, uses only the components integrated in smartphones to provide a viable navigation system for an application that supports participation in events, myMobiConf. The implemented proposal proved to be efficient for a wide range of buildings and, therefore, various types of events. In addition to using sensor fusion to compensate for errors inherent to inertial navigation systems.
