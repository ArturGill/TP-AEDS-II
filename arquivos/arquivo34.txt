The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) is the agency responsible for maintaining and making available statistical data for the entire national territory. However, the way in which the data is made available, which is not very intuitive, makes it difficult to extract data for more elaborate analysis. This article will present a system that enables data extraction in a clearer manner. Using concepts from Data Science and other computational resources, the system developed in this work is capable of capturing data provided by IBGE, formatting it in a more intuitive way and storing it in a local database, with the aim of being consulted to create graphs and analyses. The data provided by IBGE says a lot about Brazil, how Brazilians live and how public managers have spent the nation's resources. From this perspective, the project assumes social characteristics, by helping the population access information in order to question the situation in which the country finds itself. This article addresses the strategies used for easy assimilation, achieving the objective of understanding the data made available by IBGE.
