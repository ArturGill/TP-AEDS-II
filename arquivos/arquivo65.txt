This work uses data from an academic project for teaching Software Engineering as a case study to evaluate the collaborative participation of those involved. To this end, data from the repositories of the computational tools supporting the project are represented by means of graphs and subjected to the application of centrality metrics. The intention is to seek a relationship between the most central nodes, according to two of the dimensions of the 3C Collaboration Model (Coordination and Cooperation), based on the roles assumed by the students. The results obtained showed that there is a large participation of managerial roles in the Coordination tasks, as well as a greater number of Cooperation activities carried out by some of the Programmers and Testers. In addition, it was possible to perceive that some students had low involvement, not consistent with the role assumed.
