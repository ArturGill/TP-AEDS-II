The percentage of exposed fat of a bovine carcass is a statistical data used to quantify how much fat covers a carcass. This percentage is extremely relevant to assess the quality of a carcass and to price it. This statistic is obtained through an in-person analysis of the carcass by a specialist. This analysis consists of the relationship between the carcass as a whole and the regions of collagen and muscle, called regions without fat coverage. The objective of this work is to use convolutional neural networks to assist in obtaining the percentage of exposed fat. To this end, an expert labeled a set of images that segmented the carcass into three classes: one to delimit the carcass contour, one for collagen regions, and one for muscle regions. This data set was used to train a convolutional neural network for image segmentation. The results obtained were validated using the mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, which evaluates the similarity of the predicted and real bounding boxes. Using this metric and considering a threshold of 0.5, we obtained a result of 42.7% for segmentation in all classes and 98.2% for segmentation of the class that delimits the carcass contour.
