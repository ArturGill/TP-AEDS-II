Knowing the customer profile is an efficient way to offer better and more personalized services, increase satisfaction and, therefore, keep them engaged with the company. A very relevant item of the profile is the user’s personality, which can be divided into five distinct traits. However, inferring which trait a user belongs to is not a trivial task. In this work, we investigate whether personality traits can be inferred based on the categories of applications installed on a user’s mobile device. Classification and regression models were created, and the results are promising, making it possible to identify the traits with an acceptable margin of error.
