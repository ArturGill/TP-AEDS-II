With the increasing evolution and adoption of computing technologies in everyday life, it is possible to notice a visible increase in the relationship between users and data. A need was then created to resolve the volatility of any data by making it persistent and at the same time recoverable in an integral and trivial way. In this context, this work aims to explore the viability of Native XML (Extended Markup Language) Databases (NXMLDB) as an alternative to Relational Databases (RMDB) through an empirical and comparative approach. The proposed approach consists of a series of experiments given two databases (XML and SQL) and an operations script whose metrics are a function of the number of tuples processed versus the time required to process them.
