This article investigates the influence of diversity on the productivity of teams that use agile methodologies and also on the quality of the artifacts produced. To this end, a qualitative and quantitative study was conducted in the context of the industry, involving four teams with different diversity profiles. The study used two data collection methods: a questionnaire organized into three dimensions and metrics applied to data from a development support tool.
