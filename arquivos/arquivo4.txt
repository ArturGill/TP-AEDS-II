Participatory sensing networks (PSNs) are systems in which the nodes sending data are people with mobile devices. These systems often suffer from a lack of engagement from their users. myMobi-Conf is an example of an event-supporting PSN that uses a gamification approach to try to reduce this lack of engagement. Observing successful RSPs such as the social network Instagram, and the strong presence of sticker albums in Brazilian culture, this work proposes the implementation of a sticker album integrated into Instagram, as an addition to the application's gamification approach. The implementation of the sticker album during events has proven to be effective in increasing participant engagement, resulting in a more frequent return to the application throughout the event.
