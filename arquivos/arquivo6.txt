This paper presents a Web-based system that simulates a Virtual Plenary to compare the political ideologies of candidates for municipal legislative positions. The goal is to provide an interactive platform where users can participate in a virtual plenary session and, at the end, compare their choices in bills with those of elected councilors. At the end, the comparison between the user's choices and those of the councilors provides a comparative assessment of their political ideology. The system includes a user-friendly interface, data collection and processing mechanisms, and uses the PCA algorithm to construct the comparative analysis. The effectiveness and usability of the system were evaluated through tests conducted with real users.
