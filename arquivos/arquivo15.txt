Service providers lose a lot due to customer abandonment, which is called Churn in the literature. Loyalty campaigns offered to all customers can be very costly. Therefore, predicting which customers tend to Churn can be very advantageous. In this work, the performance of a graph neural network (GNN) model for Churn prediction was evaluated in comparison with a traditional random forest model and a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model using only non-sensitive customer data in a context of digital service abandonment. The results showed that the use of the graph neural network was beneficial: although it had the second best precision (61% versus 63% of the RNN) and second best F1 Macro Score (59.95% versus 61% of the RNN), it achieved better recall of the Churn class (68% versus 61.5% of the baseline and 55% of the RNN). For future work, we intend to extend the idea of ​​using graph neural networks to generic problems given by lists of events, using even more information and features of the model.
