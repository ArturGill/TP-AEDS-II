After the creation of the Law on Access to Information, all
information produced by public entities has become public,
and thus accessible to all citizens, except those that are confidential. Even though, this does not mean that it is easily
available in a user-friendly format, that is, a format in which
ordinary citizens can easily read the information when they
access it.
This paper proposes a solution for poor data availability
through a web system that aims to provide relevant municipal transparency information and easy access to users. Using
Data Science techniques, the developed system is able to display to the user information from multiple cities formatted in
a more objective manner, generating various structures such
as graphs and reports that help in the identification of possible anomalies related to public expenditure, coming from
these cities.
