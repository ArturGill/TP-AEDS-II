Power generation from thermoelectric plants has a high production cost compared to other forms, such as hydroelectric plants. There are items related to power generation, such as pressure, humidity, temperature, among others, that may present uncertainties. In this context, this work proposes the resolution of the Robust Economic Dispatch Problem for Electric Power (RPDEEE), considering the valve point loading and parametric uncertainties using the Differential Evolution (DE) metaheuristic. The proposed DE was implemented using the C language, being tested in RPDEEE instances with 13 and 40 generating units (GUs). To validate the quality of the proposed algorithm, the results were compared with the solutions of three works present in the literature. It can be concluded that the developed algorithm is valid and with nominal results close to those found in the literature, as well as presenting a lower computational cost in the robust version compared to the other works.
