The growth and diversification of the use of mobile devices, especially smartphones, has led to the emergence of a large volume of georeferenced data from mobile applications. As a result, companies are increasingly interested in analyzing such data to better understand their users and thus offer better services. The analysis of georeferenced data is an area that has not yet been explored, and it can provide more useful information than pure data. In general, current data analysis tools do not process georeferenced attributes and require users to have prior knowledge to use advanced techniques. This work proposes a system that aims to assist data analysts in the exploration and visualization of large volumes of various types of data, including georeferenced data.
