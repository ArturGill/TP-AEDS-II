The demand for increasingly faster computer networks driven by the massive use of connected devices that require high transfer rates and low latency raises issues such as congestion control in routers. In this work, we propose a router implemented in hardware with reconfigurable congestion control policies that allows the use of congestion policies at runtime without the need to recompile or restart the router when the user changes, at runtime, the way congestion should be handled. Our work was implemented on the NetFPGA 1Gb platform and tested in a real environment. Our results show that our architecture allows changing congestion policies at runtime, dynamically controlling congestion without using the network leaf nodes.
