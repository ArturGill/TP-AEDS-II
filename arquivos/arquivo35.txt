Applications store a growing volume of messages posted by their users, which may reflect their opinions on a given topic. This scenario becomes the target of the Sentiment Analysis process, which aims to extract the emotional polarity expressed in a given textual form, in order to obtain relevant knowledge. Based on this point, this work deals with the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, as well as a supervised machine learning method, based on Bayes' Theorem, with the aim of building a model capable of estimating sentiments from the opinions of users of the MyMobiConf application, considering messages in Portuguese. Its performance is evaluated using metrics specific to this class of algorithms, so that results demonstrate satisfactory precision for the context in question.
