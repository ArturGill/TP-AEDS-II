Transfer learning consists of using models related to the solution of a task to improve the learning of another. It is an important topic, since it deals with problems commonly faced during the construction of machine learning solutions, such as data quality and quantity. The objective of this study was to evaluate how the use of transfer learning techniques can affect, positively or negatively, the sentiment analysis model present in the MyMobiConf event support system. To this end, the TrAdaBoost algorithm was implemented, which aims to perform instance transfer, and the behavior of the final model generated was analyzed. The results of the work showed that the use of the selected algorithm can be beneficial, in the presented parameters, when the number of iterations for it is up to 25 iterations, resulting in an increase of up to 9% in the accuracy of the model.
