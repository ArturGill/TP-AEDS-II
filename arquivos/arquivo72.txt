This paper presents an approach for creating a communication network between stakeholders involved in a software project. The network is generated from communication data present in isue tracking environments and software repositories, combining three approaches available in the literature: thematic relevance, sentiment analysis and social network analysis. The purpose of the network is to enable the identification of key stakeholders in the communication process, based on the calculation of node centrality. In order to automate the application of the approach, the ColMiner 2.0 tool was developed and will be presented. With the tool, the user will be able to extract data from GitHub, generate the network and customize the measurements present in the nodes and edges. Finally, a proof of concept will be presented as a way to evaluate the proposed approach, relating the most central stakeholders of the network with those who have committed the most code.
