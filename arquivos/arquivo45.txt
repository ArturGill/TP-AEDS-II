The design of a radio-controlled aircraft consists of a series of factors that require the designer to make detailed decisions about each part of the aircraft. In most cases, such decisions are directly related to the designer's experience, so that the success of the project depends largely on the knowledge of this developer. This work proposes the use of a genetic algorithm in the optimization of a wing aerodynamic profile, with the objective of assisting in aircraft design decisions to maximize the load carried by the air vehicle, considering the rules of the SAE BRASIL AeroDesign competition. The data generated were obtained through the original analytical equation of the distance and through an approximate expression generated by genetic programming. As a result, comparisons are made between the values ​​obtained with both the analytical equation and the approximate expression. The results obtained presented satisfactory aerodynamic profile configurations capable of transporting masses whose values ​​exceed some aerodynamic profiles known in the literature.
