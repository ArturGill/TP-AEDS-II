Data security has become a crucial factor in the context of computer networks. Between 2015 and 2020, it is estimated that the loss caused by information theft on the Internet will be R$ 26 trillion. In this scenario, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential elements in the search for threats. However, IDSs are installed on conventional machines with little processing power and high operational costs. Offloading network functions on SmartNICs and the Serverless paradigm emerge as efficient solutions, as they combine flexibility and programmability with packet processing power in hardware. In this work, we propose a Serverless IDS with offloading of user-defined filters on the Netronome SmartNIC. Different filters were created using eBPF technology to validate the system. The results obtained show that attacks are detected at line rate.
