Studies on mobility flows have become increasingly relevant due to the significant increase in data collection devices and applications. Despite this, there are few studies that address this topic, as well as tools that assist in this aspect. In this work, a tool was implemented that seeks to facilitate studies related to mobility flow, in addition to demonstrating its application in a case study, evaluating the impact that the implementation of safe routes causes in the city of São Paulo. With the results, it is clear that this solution can improve studies already done in the area of ​​mobility, providing more detail about the changes made, and how this impact reflects on displacements.
