Packet congestion in a computer network causes loss of system performance. This proposal aims to improve the performance of computer networks in data centers, especially in congestion scenarios. The standard congestion control protocol in data centers is Data Center TCP (DCTCP). This paper proposes two approaches: i) the use of the hysteresis technique in switch queues to mark packets, indicating congestion; ii) the return of packets to the sender to reduce the sending rate when congestion occurs. The approaches were implemented in P4 language using programmable switches and validated together with DCTCP. The results show that both proposed solutions improve network throughput.
