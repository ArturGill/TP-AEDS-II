The optimization of the power distribution in thermoelectric power system is vital, since
the generation costs are high, making it expensive. The problem of economic dispatch is precisely
to solve the problem by modeling a continuous optimization problem in an attempt to minimize
these costs. Aiming for more realism, this paper presents a proposal using Bee Algorithm, called
PDEZOPs-BA, to solve the problem with the Prohibited Operating Zones(POZ) variant, which adds
discontinuity to the dispatch problem. This paper presents results obtained through case studies
based on the problem of economic dispatch with POZs, with the purpose of validating PDEZOPsBA.
